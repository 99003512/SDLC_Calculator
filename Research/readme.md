1. what is Calculator?

- A Calculator is a simple electronic hardware device or a software capable of performing the simple calculations such as addition,multiplications,subtraction,division,finding square roots,percentages and conversions etc.
- In 1957,the Casio computer company developed the first electronic calculator.
- A simple numeric keypad is present to enter the numbers into the calculator.
- Calculators can also built into most operating systems on computers,smart phones and also tablets.

1. Where we use Scientific Calculator?

- Examination halls
- Colleges
- Computers
- Labs

1. When we use calculators?

Calculators are useful during examinations for getting complex calculations in very less time. For finding trigonometric values, hyperbolic functions, inverses. While calculating bills in malls and restaurants, these calculators are very useful. Engineering students will use this type of calculator to do complex operations on power values, exponentials etc.

1. Why we use calculators?

- Complex calculations are very tough to calculate in less time.So this scientific calculator is useful for all operations.
- To get the results very accurately.
- To save our valuable time.
- Saves human power.

1. How to make the Scientific calculator?

Input will be given by the user from the keyboard and the result will be displayed to the screen i,e output will be on the screen.

- Write the code for all the requirements.
- Use one programming language for coding the required functions.
- Use &#39;C&#39; programming language for the purpose of coding to make this scientific calculators.
- Use github and visual studio for making and building file for required specifications.
- Use electronic hardware to embedded code into the processor.
- Check correctly of all functionalities.
